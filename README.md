## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer is a tool for visualizing various sorting algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.

## Features

- Visualization of sorting algorithms in real-time.
- Multiple sorting algorithms available, including bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
- Intuitive user interface for selecting sorting algorithms and adjusting visualization settings.

## Getting Started

To use the Sorting Visualizer, you have two options:

1. **Visit the Public Link:**
   - Simply visit the [link](https://talalzeini.github.io/sorting-visualizer/) in your web browser.
  
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine by clicking this [link](https://github.com/talalzeini/sorting-visualizer/archive/master.zip).
   - Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
   - Launch the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
  
- `styles.css`: Styling file for the web page.
- `script.js`: Responsible for setting up the visualization canvas, coordinating the main logic, and handling the visualization of the sorting algorithms.
- `stopwatch.js`: Contains utility functions for stopwatch functionality.
- `sorting/`: Directory containing individual files for each sorting algorithm (e.g., `bubble.js`, `selection.js`, `insertion.js`).
- `helpers.js`: Utility functions for sorting algorithms.
- `buttons.js`: Functions for managing buttons and UI interactions.
- `screen.js`: Functions for managing the screen layout and responsiveness.

These files collectively provide the structure and functionality for the Sorting Visualizer application.
